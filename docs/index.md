# Welcome to wai-annotations

wai-annotations is a Python library for converting between annotation formats of data domains such as 
images and audio. With its command-line tools, you can, e.g., create conversion pipelines or split
dataset batches.

The library also offers plugins for preprocessing data, for generating statistics and visualizations, 
as well as incorporating predictions made via a Redis backend (e.g., using deep learning models).

# Conversion options for wai-annotations

The following options can be specified before any stages in the conversion chain, and globally affect the process of
converting datasets:

* `-h`, `--help`: Lists this set of conversion options and then exits.

* `-v`: Optional argument to set the logging verbosity of the conversion. Can be
        specified multiple times to further increase verbosity.
        
* `--macro-file`: The macros to use during the conversion.
